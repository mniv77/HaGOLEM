SUBJECT: Android for Humanoid Robots - $8M Seed ($20M pre)

[VC Name],

I'm building the Android for humanoid robots. Not the hardware - the SOFTWARE platform 
that will run on millions of robots.

Tesla, Boston Dynamics, and Chinese manufacturers are building the bodies. Nobody owns 
the operating system yet. 12-month window to win.

THREE WAYS TO UNDERSTAND THIS:

1. Quick Read (3 min): The Story in Plain English
   https://www.mayyamw.com/HR2-hagolem

2. Investor Brief (10 min): Executive Summary  
   https://www.mayyamw.com/HR1-hraimn

3. Technical Deep-Dive (20 min): For Your Engineers
   https://www.mayyamw.com/hr9-technical-plan

THE OPPORTUNITY:

- Platform: Android-based (free, proven, 3B+ devices)
- Timeline: 18 months to production
- Team: US (civilian) + Israel (military/hardware)
- Raising: $8M at $20M pre-money
- Exit: NVIDIA acquisition $15-30B (years 5-7)

PROOF I EXECUTE:

Built live trading system at age 70 (403% returns, 99% win rate):

This proves AI-assisted development works. Same method builds HOS.

15-MINUTE CALL?

I respect your time. 15 minutes to explain why this is the next $200B platform play.

P.P.S. In a few years, my HR will drive me to our meeting, then go earn money 
driving Uber while we talk. Hope you invested by then! 😊

Why?
✓ Not too long (they'll read it)
✓ Not too short (shows substance)  
✓ Three clear links (they choose depth)
✓ Proof point (trading system)
✓ Clear ask (15-minute call)

Which version do you prefer?
